 * One indexable explainer per Microsoft 365 waste-detection rule, rendered at

 * the README rules table, the thresholds exported from
 * ~/server/waste/engine.ts (30-day never-active grace, 90-day default
 * inactivity window, 60-day Copilot window, the shelfware exemptions), the
 * graceful-degradation section of the README and the read-only scopes in
 * ~/lib/scopes.ts. Euro figures come exclusively from DEMO_FIGURES, which
 * demoFigures.test.ts recomputes from the demo fixtures and the rules engine.
 * PowerShell snippets were verified against Microsoft Learn (Get-MgUser
 * advanced queries, the signInActivity filter, Get-MgSubscribedSku and the
 * beta getMicrosoft365CopilotUsageUserDetail report).
